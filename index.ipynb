    "\n",
    "Now that we have our data, the fun part begins. We'll need to begin by preprocessing and cleaning our text data. As you've seen throughout this section, preprocessing text data is a bit more challenging that working with more traditional data types because there's no clear-cut answer for exactly what sort of preprocessing and cleaning we need to do. When working with traditional datasets, our goals are generally pretty clear for this stage--normalize and clean our numerical data, convert categorical data to a numeric format, check for and deal with multicollinearity, etc. The steps we take are largely dependent on what the data already looks like when we get a hold of it. Text data is different--if we inspect our dataset, we'll see that it has 1 dimension--the only existing feature in our dataset right now is one that contains all of the actual articles. This means that we need to make some decisions about how to preprocess our data. Before we can begin cleaning and preprocessing our text data, we need to make some decisions about things such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we remove stop words, or not?\n",
    "* Do we stem or lemmatize our text data, or leave the words as is?\n",
    "* Is basic tokenization enough, or do we need to support special edge cases through the use of regex?\n",
    "* Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?\n",
    "* Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?\n",
    "* What sort of vectorization should we use in our model? Boolean Vectorization? Count Vectorization? TF-IDF? More advanced vectorization strategies such as Word2Vec?\n",

    "At first glance, none of these words seem very informative--for most of the words represented here, it would be tough to guess if a given word is used equally among all 5 classes, or is disproportionately represented among a single class. This makes sense, because this frequency distribution  represents all the classes combined. This tells us that these words probably the least important, as they are most likely words that are used across multiple classes, thereby providing our model with little actual signal as to what class they belong to.
